# Pre-eruptive-water-content-calculation

This is a discretization method of calculating the buffer overlapping area (BOA) of two buffers in P-T space, based on Di et al. ([2020](https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2020-7137)).

Environment: Python 3


The input data should be like:

primary melt composition:

**# SiO2 TiO2 Al2O3 TFe2O3 MgO CaO Na2O K2O P2O5 TOTAL**

52.74 	2.45 	13.88 	8.49 	0.11 	6.17 	5.50 	3.86 	5.53 	99.69 
...

(The order of the species does not matter, while all the species must be included. The input primary melt compositions should be in equlibrium with olivine + orthopyroxene)

Clinopyroxene(Cpx)-melt thermobarometer is calculated by the formula below, according to Putirka et al. ([2003](https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2003-1017)) 

**# T p**

1051.29405	2.04854

...

(the unit of T: Â°C, the unit of p: kbar. The input P-T should be from equilibrated cpx-melt pairs.)

Manual:
1. Click the green button "clone or download" to get the whole repository into a local device.
2. Make sure that Python 3 has been already installed, as well as numpy and matplotlib.
3. Copy and Paste your primary melt composition and cpx-melt P-T data into ./data/primary_melt_composition.txt and ./data/cpx_melt.txt, respectively.
4. Change the parameters in config.py. The changeable parameters include a melt Fe3+ proportion (Fe3+/FeT), errors of the thermobarometers, intended H2O content range and increment, and the size of unit.
5. Run "python demo.py" to get the outcome.
6. The outcome is a figure showing a scatter of H2O content (.wt%) and BOA as well as printing them on the screen.
